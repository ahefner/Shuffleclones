Shuffleclones: Comparative Shuffletron
======================================

This respository is intended to collect simple reimplementations of a subset of the Shuffletron music player (originally written in Common Lisp) in various languages.

Presently, only an implementation in C++ is done. In the future, a feature-comparable subset of the Lisp version should be extracted for comparison. In the mean time, the definitive Lisp version of Shuffletron can be found at https://github.com/ahefner/shuffletron
